This is a social organization experiment and an entrepreneurial project.

What kind of organization is this?
--------------
Here is a DAO organization, a decentralized autonomous organization, an organization that is completely different from traditional corporate organizations. The company is built for the purpose of profit. Several managers lead a group of employees to work together for the purpose of achieving profit, and pay wages regularly to maintain this relationship between employees and the organization.

However, here, the establishment is not entirely for the purpose of profit, of course, it is entirely possible for members to realize the possibility of income here. This purpose can be established by the first founder, or modified or re-initiated by subsequent founders. To get right to the point, the first purpose of this organization that I (the first founder) set up is to build an organization that is self-governing and continues to grow. In order to achieve the above goals, I hope to achieve through a series of rules and incentives.

Basic rules
-------
1. Voluntarily join and voluntarily leave
2. The way to join is to initiate a Merge Request in this Repo, and send out basic personal information and skills you are good at. After the review, the representative joins the organization.
3. The project sponsor (a role of the organization) can initiate projects that are beneficial to the development of the organization from time to time. It can be a tool for improving organizational management, or it can provide a suggestion to make the members of the organization feel happier. Of course, it can also be It is a profitable project. All members have the opportunity to participate in this project. After completion, project points will be allocated to project members according to the sharing degree of the project to the organization, and points will be allocated to project participants according to the members' contribution. (The mechanism of point distribution is based on the principle of being as fair and just as possible, through the review of the point distribution committee, and a limited number of appeal opportunities to ensure the fairness of the point distribution system).
4. Voting system, founders, project sponsors, and point distribution committee members are elected from all members through regular voting meetings. The voting system for each role is described in detail below:
    1. The founder. After the founder is the first to opt out or voluntarily downgrade to a member, all members will participate in the voting, and the votes of each member will be weighted according to their points (contribution).
    2. Project sponsors, each fixed cycle has the opportunity to generate any number of project sponsors. The project sponsors are fully responsible for the project. After completion, 60% of the project points will be divided into their personal points. Leaving the project or the project does not achieve the expected goals, it will not have points. However, project members can still earn points based on their contribution.
    3. In the points distribution committee, the chairman is elected by voting, and the voting mechanism is consistent with the founder voting mechanism. Committee members are also voted, but members' votes are not weighted according to points.

Incentives
